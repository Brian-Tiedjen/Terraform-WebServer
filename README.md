This project is planned to be a fully built out cloud infrastrucuture to demo some of the following components and show my familiarity with them

- VPC
- NAT Gateway (single)
- Subnets
- ALBs
- EC2 instances and configuration (add user data from github)
- IAM and use with EC2 instances
- Security Groups
- Cloud Watch (both logs and alarms)
- Terraform as IAC
- S3 bucket back end with DynomoDB locking



Note:
This is a personal project and not affiliated with my employer in any way. All resources created in this project are for demo purposes only and should not be used in production or sensitive environments.
